Currently, this isn't useful for anyone, unless you want to help to move the
MOL kernel module into the kernel.

Done:
 * Remove old kernel version code
 * Remove Darwin code
 * Removed some header files
 * Ran lindent on .c files
 * Removed some dead code

In Progress:
 * Tighten up code by removing functions that aren't needed
 * Inline code that was previously a function due to multiple OS support

TODO:
 * Review and remove unneded code (dead code, etc.)
 * Remove code that's duplicated in the kernel
 * Document and ensure that comments make sense
 * Review for kernel inclusion (checkpatch, etc.)
 * Probably lots more
